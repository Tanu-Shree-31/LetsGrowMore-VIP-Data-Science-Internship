## Problem Statement
- Stock market investments generate great profits and is a fundamental stimulus for most of the market researchers in this area.

- Most researchers use either technical or fundamental analysis.

### Technical Analysis:
Technical analysis focuses on analyzing the direction of prices to predict future prices.

### Fundamental Analysis:
Fundamental analysis depends on analyzing unstructured textual information like financial news and earning reports.Performing fundamental analysis using machine learning techniques is quite interesting as it's mostly based on analysing text and sentiments.

- We need to solve the problem statement in an unsupervised way which could be a hit or miss in many situations.

- The problem statement here comes under regression type where the features are made up of past data feeds and the target is the current value.
